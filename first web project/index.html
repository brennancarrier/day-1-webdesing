    <h1>How To Play Volleyball</h1>

    

    <ol>
    <li>The game is played between two teams of six players each, with three on the court at a time.</li>
    <li>The object of the game is to ground your opponent's ball in their half of the court or touch it illegally.</li>
    <li>To start, each team places the ball in their own half of the court. The serve must be hit below the top of the net and diagonally across to the opposite side of the court.</li>
    <li>After serving, your team is trying to keep the opposing team from touching the ball; they have three touches (or hits) to return it before it goes out of bounds or over the net.</li>
    <li>You can make contact with the ball using any part of your body except your arms (which are too big and will give you an illegal advantage). Your legal hitting tools are: hands, forearms, chest, head, and back.</li>
    <li>The serve must be tossed straight up at least 12 inches and then struck by the opposite hand or arm in a way that sends it over the net into the opponent's court.</li>
    <li>If the ball hits the net and comes down on your side, you get another chance to serve—this is called a "fault."</li>
    <li>A point can only be scored if the opposing team commits a fault (illegal hit, two touches, etc.) or if they fail to return the ball in bounds.</li>
    <li>The first team to reach 25 points wins, but if the score reaches 24-24, the game goes to 30 points.</li>
    <li>You must alternate between your right and left hands when you hit the ball (it has to bounce once on your side of the net before you can attack).</li>
